 abstract = {An idealized and numerical approach aimed at simulating interactions between coastal currents and topographic lee waves is presented.
The focus is on the area around the Portofino Promontory, an abrupt headland with a roughly rectangular shape.
The main objective is to evaluate the change in the response to the headland due to the background current field. 
When coastal currents maintain the obstacle on the right, recirculating eddies and turbulent wakes form in the lee of the cape.
Conversely, when a current maintains the headland on the left, topographic lee waves move against it and offshore flows, jets and squirts occur.
The roles of advective terms with respect to bottom friction and rotation are assessed in terms of equivalent Reynolds number (Re_f) and Rossby number (Ro).
Re_f is varied between 100 and Re_f→∞ while Ro varies between 0.4 and 1.0.
Difference in the results are quantified using synthetic lagrangian drifters.
After three days, in the case of an obstacle on the left, the absolute dispersion generated is 20 km larger than with an obstacle on the right.
Topographic lee waves travelling in the opposite direction of the coastal current enhance across-shore dispersion in the offshore area of about 4 km.
Stagnation in the obstacle lee forms only when the flow maintains the headland on the right and has important effects on both dispersion and residence times.
After 7 days, the average number of drifters remaining in the lee of an obstacle on the right is more than double with respect to the case with an obstacle on the left.
Residence times evaluated after three days of simulation are 1.5 days and 0.5 days for an obstacle on the right and on the left, respectively.
These results have important effects for dispersion of different substances at sea, like pollutants, nutrients, sediments, larvae and planktonic organisms.},
