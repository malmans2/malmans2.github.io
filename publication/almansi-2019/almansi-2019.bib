 abstract = {Simulations of ocean currents using numerical circulation models are becoming increasingly realistic. At the same time, these models generate increasingly large volumes of model output data. These trends make analysis of the model data harder for two reasons. First, researchers must use high-performance data-analysis clusters to access these large data sets. Second, they must post-process the data to extract oceanographically-useful information. Moreover, the increasing model realism encourages researchers to compare simulations to observations of the natural ocean. To achieve this task model data must be analyzed in the way observational oceanographers analyze field measurements; and, ideally, by the observational oceanographers themselves. The OceanSpy package addresses these needs.},
