When exiting Denmark Strait these dense water masses sink to depth and feed the deep circulation in the North Atlantic. Based on one year of mooring observations upstream of Denmark Strait and historical hydrographic profiles between Fram Strait and Denmark Strait we find that a large part (75 %) of the overflow water (σθ ≥ 27.8 kg m−3) transported by the EGC is of Atlantic origin (potential temperature θ  0 °C). The along-stream changes in temperature of the Atlantic-origin Water are moderate north of 69°N at the northern end of Blosseville Basin, but southward from this point the temperature decreases more rapidly. We hypothesize that this enhanced modification is related to the bifurcation of the EGC taking place close to 69°N into the shelfbreak EGC and the separated EGC. This is associated with enhanced eddy activity and strong water mass modification reducing the intermediate temperature and salinity maxima of the Atlantic-origin Water. During periods with a large (small) degree of modification the separated current is strong (weak). Output from a high-resolution numerical model supports our hypothesis and reveals that large eddy activity is associated with an offshore shift of the surface freshwater layer that characterizes the Greenland shelf. The intensity of the eddy activity regulates the density and the hydrographic properties of the Denmark Strait Overflow Water transported by the EGC system.

Mooring measurements in the center of the strait reveal that warm water “flooding events” occur, whereby the North Icelandic Irminger Current (NIIC) propagates offshore and advects subtropical-origin water northward through the deepest part of the sill. Two other types of mesoscale processes in Denmark Strait have been described previously in the literature, known as “boluses” and “pulses,” associated with a raising and lowering of the overflow water interface. Our measurements reveal that flooding events occur in conjunction with especially pronounced pulses. The model indicates that the NIIC hydrographic front is maintained by a balance between frontogenesis by the large-scale flow and frontolysis by baroclinic instability. Specifically, the temperature and salinity tendency equations demonstrate that the eddies act to relax the front, while the mean flow acts to sharpen it. Furthermore, the model reveals that the two dense water processes—boluses and pulses (and hence flooding events)—are dynamically related to each other and tied to the meandering of the hydrographic front in the strait. Our study thus provides a general framework for interpreting the short-time-scale variability of Denmark Strait Overflow Water entering the Irminger Sea.","tags":null,"title":"Frontogenesis and Variability in Denmark Strait and Its Influence on Overflow Water","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mattia Almansi","Renske Gelderloos","Thomas W.

At the same time, these models generate increasingly large volumes of model output data. These trends make analysis of the model data harder for two reasons. First, researchers must use high-performance data-analysis clusters to access these large data sets. Second, they must post-process the data to extract oceanographically-useful information. Moreover, the increasing model realism encourages researchers to compare simulations to observations of the natural ocean. To achieve this task model data must be analyzed in the way observational oceanographers analyze field measurements; and, ideally, by the observational oceanographers themselves. The OceanSpy package addresses these needs.","tags":null,"title":"OceanSpy: A Python package to facilitate ocean model data analysis and visualization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["I. A.

The model hydrography and circulation in the vicinity of Denmark Strait show good agreement with available observational datasets. This study focuses on the variability of the Denmark Strait overflow (DSO) by detecting and characterizing boluses and pulses, which are the two dominant mesoscale features in the strait. The authors estimate that the yearly mean southward volume flux of the DSO is about 30% greater in the presence of boluses and pulses. On average, boluses (pulses) are 57.1 (27.5) h long, occur every 3.2 (5.5) days, and are more frequent during the summer (winter). Boluses (pulses) increase (decrease) the overflow cross-sectional area, and temperatures around the overflow interface are colder (warmer) by about 2.6°C (1.8°C). The lateral extent of the boluses is much greater than that of the pulses. In both cases the along-strait equatorward flow of dense water is enhanced but more so for pulses. The sea surface height (SSH) rises by 4–10 cm during boluses and by up to 5 cm during pulses. The SSH anomaly contours form a bowl (dome) during boluses (pulses), and the two features cross the strait with a slightly different orientation. The cross streamflow changes direction; boluses (pulses) are associated with veering (backing) of the horizontal current. The model indicates that boluses and pulses play a major role in controlling the variability of the DSO transport into the Irminger Sea.

The focus is on the area around the Portofino Promontory, an abrupt headland with a roughly rectangular shape. The main objective is to evaluate the change in the response to the headland due to the background current field.  When coastal currents maintain the obstacle on the right, recirculating eddies and turbulent wakes form in the lee of the cape. Conversely, when a current maintains the headland on the left, topographic lee waves move against it and offshore flows, jets and squirts occur. The roles of advective terms with respect to bottom friction and rotation are assessed in terms of equivalent Reynolds number (Re_f) and Rossby number (Ro). Re_f is varied between 100 and Re_f→∞ while Ro varies between 0.4 and 1.0. Difference in the results are quantified using synthetic lagrangian drifters. After three days, in the case of an obstacle on the left, the absolute dispersion generated is 20 km larger than with an obstacle on the right. Topographic lee waves travelling in the opposite direction of the coastal current enhance across-shore dispersion in the offshore area of about 4 km. Stagnation in the obstacle lee forms only when the flow maintains the headland on the right and has important effects on both dispersion and residence times. After 7 days, the average number of drifters remaining in the lee of an obstacle on the right is more than double with respect to the case with an obstacle on the left. Residence times evaluated after three days of simulation are 1.5 days and 0.5 days for an obstacle on the right and on the left, respectively. These results have important effects for dispersion of different substances at sea, like pollutants, nutrients, sediments, larvae and planktonic organisms.","tags":null,"title":"Dynamics and Dispersion Around a Rectangular Headland: the Promontorio of Portofino","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Denmark Strait is a channel located between Iceland and Greenland.
